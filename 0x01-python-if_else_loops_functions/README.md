# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
In this project, I started utilizing conditionals and loops in Python by using ``if``, ``if ... else``, ``break``, ``continue``, ``pass``, and ``range`` statements with ``while`` and ``for loops``. I practiced writing my own Python functions while learning about scope of variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.

### Tasks
+ ####  0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
+ [0-positive_or_negative.py](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/0-positive_or_negative.py): This program will assign a random signed ``number`` to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable ``number`` is positive or negative.

+ You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py)
+ The variable ``number`` will store a different value every time you will run this program
+ You don’t have to understand what ``import``, ``random``. randint do. Please do not touch this code
+ The output of the program should be:
	+ The number, followed by
		+ if the number is greater than 0: ``is positive``
		+ if the number is 0: ``is zero``
		+ if the number is less than 0: ``is negative``
	+ followed by a new line
