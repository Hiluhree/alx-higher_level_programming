### Tasks
+ Task 0: [Run Python file](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-python-hello_world/0-run): A Shell script that runs a Python script.

	- The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable ``$PYFILE``
+ Task 1: [Run inline](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-python-hello_world/1-run_inline): A Shell script that runs Python code.

	- The Python code will be saved in the environment variable ``$PYCODE``
+ Task 2: [Hello, print](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-python-hello_world/2-print.py): A Python script that prints exactly ``"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line``.

	- Use the function ``print``
+ Task 3: [Print integer](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-python-hello_world/3-print_number.py): Complete this [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py) in order to print the integer stored in the variable ``number``, followed ``by Battery street``, followed by a new line.

	+ You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py)
	+ The output of the script should be:
		- the``number``, followed by ``Battery street``,
		- followed by a new line
	+ You are not allowed to cast the variable ``number`` into a string
	+ Your code must be 3 lines long
	+ You have to use f-strings [tips](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/)
+ Task 4: [Print float](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-python-hello_world/4-print_float.py): Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable ``number`` with a precision of 2 digits.

	+ You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py)
	+ The output of the program should be:
		- ``Float:``, followed by the float with only 2 digits
		- followed by a new line
	+ You are not allowed to cast ``number`` to string
	+ You have to use f-strings
+ Task 5: [Print string](https://github.com/Hiluhree/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-python-hello_world/5-print_string.py): Complete this [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py) in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable ``str``, followed by its first 9 characters.

	+ You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py)
	+ The output of the program should be:
		- 3 times the value of ``str``
		- followed by a new line
		- followed by the 9 first characters of ``str``
		- followed by a new line
	+ You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement
	+ Your program should be maximum 5 lines long
